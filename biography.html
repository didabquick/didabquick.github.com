        <p>
          Melissa Riling grew up in a little Connecticut town full of trees called Easton.  After growing up creating and playing in the woods, she moved out to formally focus on her art.  She spent two years at SUNY Purchase studying painting and three years at MassArt in Boston studying illustration, fashion, and sculpture.

          Her earliest memory of art came during an episode of Barney.  An artist came onto the show.  Melissa heard him say that his favorite color was white because, her young ears heard, he could pee on it.  She thought that maybe a white toilet bowl was art.  (A very precocious dada-ist, perhaps?)
        </p>
        <p>Melissaâ€™s artwork generally consists of drawing, water color painting, collage, sewing, dyeing, gluing, and general experimenting.  She makes work in Philadelphia, where she just moved and is loving.
